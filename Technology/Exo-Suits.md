The Exo Suit is a performance enhancer made to help soldiers in the field react faster and preform better.
The use of the Exo Suits was first pioneered by [[Telpenten]] while they were building the [[Outbreak#Walls|Fellands Walls]]. The original use of them was to increase workers movement speed.
After the [[Outbreak#Military Intervention|military intervention]], exo-suits were quickly adopted and standardized by the military.
Exo-suits have been innovated on tremendously since the [[Outbreak|outbreak]]. With side by side development with [[Telpenten]] and later [[Verdanta]] with [[Plug-Suits]] the Exo suit is standard issue to every solider upon exiting basic training.
# Types
## TEIR 1
They can handle some difficult task however they are meant to assist and make some job easier. These are usually employed by those with difficulties walking, standing, or other mobility issues. They are also used for traditional construction jobs where 1 person with an Exo Suit can allow for another person to work elsewhere.
## TEIR 2
They can handle the same things as a TEIR 1 with the added bonus of slightly increasing the capacities of the wearers body. This is often employed in high stress environments such as the building of [[The Prism]] or touch up on [[Outbreak Events#Walls|the walls]].
## TEIR 3
They can handle the same things as TEIR 1 and 2 but also boost the abilities of the wearer. These require a [[Plug-Suits#Combat Grade|Combat Grade Plug-Suits]] to handle the strain as more than 15 seconds without one kills the wearer from frying the brain. These are mainly used by the military or bounty hunters.
