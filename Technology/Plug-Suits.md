A plug suit a the interface barrier between the wearer and the [[Exo-Suits]]. Invented after being adopted by the [[Ruscoaria]] military they help ease the load on the wearers mind.
The plug-suits originally were latex with the electronics half embedded into the top of it however after some internal development by [[Verdanta]] they now act as a second skin and interface cleanly with the [[Exo-Suits]].
# Types
## Low Density
Low Density plug-suits were the first type to be made. They allow someone to use a [[Exo-Suits#TEIR 1|TEIR 1 Exo-Suit]] without the need of a spine implant. This does require regular breaks due to the strain on the body.
## High Density
High Density plug suits were created to solve the issue of needing break with its Low Density counterpart. With the added bonus of no breaks via the use of significantly more [[Cybernira]] in the suit, they also work with [[Exo-Suits#TEIR 2|TEIR 2 Exo-Suits]].
## Combat Grade
Combat Grade plug suits are made to even out the stress of wearing a [[Exo-Suits#TEIR 3|TEIR 3 Exo-Suit]]. These put enough stress to kill the person through sheer mental overload. These plug-suits are grafted into the wearers skin and are often a sign of high ranking military personnel or someone with lots of money and power.
# Implementations
## Over skin
Over Skin plug-suits are suits that simply are worn over the wearers body. There are 2 types those being A and B
### Type A
Type A Over Skin are an updated version of the old latex with embedded electronics. Now using a new hybrid of latex and [[Cybernira]].
### Type B
Type B is similar to Type A with a bit of hybridization with To Skin implementations. Using a spinal implant the same suit as Type A is used with more traces that connect into the spinal implant. Due to the possible conflicts with [[Augments#Cybernetic|Cybernetic Augments]] Type A is preferred over Type B
## To Skin
To Skin implementations are usually grafted into the skin with some even replacing parts of the body with [[Augments#Cybernetic|Cybernetic Augments]] to get around areas where grafting is not recommended.
# Variations
There are many standard variations to plug suits and even more custom ones for each persons fancy. Some people even get custom plug suits that allow for detachable [[Augments#Cybernetic|cybernetic augments]].
## Race
The racial variations tend to be for allowing limbs to move freely or modifications for that races body type or shape.
## Cultural
Cultural variations are hard to work with in many cases and these suits tend to be custom ordered to fit the wearer.
## Occupational
Occupational variations are 1 in a million however the most common ones are for construction and military use.
