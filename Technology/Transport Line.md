# Purpose
Moves all resources and people across the world. Used to prepare airdrops for the [[Fellands]] too. Is also used as a mobile weapon by the military when mass infected breach the exclusion area.
## Standardization
28 years after the start of the [[Cruxolutions]] buyup, the company began standardizing the entire transport line. Starting with the track gauge, and material, everything that wasn't the 900m (2ft 11 7/16in) width that was used by [[Cruxolutions]] was changed over immediately despite the revenue loss. Next was the changing of the train engines and cars to match the same ones already in use. This was called amongst the engineers "The Great Scrappening"
