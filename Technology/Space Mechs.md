The Space Mechs were made for planetary travel and travel just outside of the [[Canevery Space Station|space station]]. They were made to replace the [[Exo-Suits]] due to their superior protection and weapon capability
With their creation having been pioneered by [[Verdanta]] with help from [[Cruxolutions#Astraveel|Astraveel]]. They were first used to retrieve samples from the nearby moon for study.
After the first successful retrieval mission, the continued research of the mechs split between both [[Cruxolutions#Astraveel|Astraveel]] and [[Verdanta]].
Due to the increased stress and new linking requirements, a new plug-suit was developed to make sure the pilots don't die from the stress.
## Plug-Suits
The new plug suits expanded on the [[Plug-Suits#Combat Grade|Combat Grade]] [[Plug-Suits#Over skin|Over Skin]] design of the old [[Plug-Suits]]. The new design uses even more [[Cybernira]] with a latex base allowing for significantly more connections than [[Exo-Suits]].
