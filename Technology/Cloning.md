Cloning was an accidental discovery during attempts at growing organs for transplant purposes.

## [[Verdanta]] Experiments
After the discovery that growing a human over a very very basic [[Race Supplement#Mechanica|Mechanica]] frame was easier than trying to grow a 100% human from scratch. These experiments were mostly failures as the process of getting the grown body to take well to the [[Race Supplement#Mechanica|Mechanica]] frame and brain was extremely finicky.
### The Ban
After a major leak from [[Verdanta]], the public became aware of the process of cloning and the [[Ruscoaria]] and [[Eplon]] government quickly banned the practice with [[Ituk]] following suit not too long after
## [[Relmera]] Experiments
Using the discovery of [[Kanaveer]] and the [[Verdanta]] Experiments with early cloning as a base, [[Relmera]] was able to create a much more successful version of cloning. This is done by using a small amount of programmed [[Kanaveer]] to seed a few major organs and let them grow and weave themselves together. The entire process takes months of careful observation and minor tweaks and additions as the programmed [[Kanaveer]] does its job.
