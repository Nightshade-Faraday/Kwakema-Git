Alarms were going off and everyone was running. [[Asta Sparx|Asta]] didn't know where they were running to or if they were after em, but ey were getting out of here. Ey crawled through another service vent before landing in another maintenance room. This one led right out to the pods that led to a [[Hyperlanes|Hyperlane]] connection. How did it now that? Why did it know that? That wasn't important, all that mattered now was getting out of here.

Guards swarmed the dock, each one checking the pods and searching the people for em. [[Asta Sparx|Asta]] wasn't sure what to do. Escape was so close, but one mistake would lead to eir death or worse, going back to be an experiment. Wait, how did it know that? Never mind, it was getting distracted again. Ey waited for a moment where they might be able to run, for a while it looked it would never come. Each guard was vigilant with their movements and very rarely strayed, but they did stray.

It was during one of these moments where [[Asta Sparx|Asta]] struck. Without realizing ey shifted into a wolf like form and bolted out into the open, dodging the gaze of soldiers and squeezing into a corner of a drop ship taking supplies to another planet. 

Ey were safe...
Ey were free...


For now.
