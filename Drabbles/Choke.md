You ever felt a poison so strong that it killed you twice? Felt it worm its way deep into your lungs, filling every single nook and cranny. Stifling you of all oxygen and thick enough to clog your veins.
No? Hehehe, would you like to?

I woke up to water being splashed in my face. The room was pretty well lit, almost too well lit as my eyes burned from the harsh florescence lights. In the corner cleaning something was a woman in blood stained clothes with goggles and a respirator.

"Sorry for the harsh wake up, but I needed you awake and aware for the best results." They spoke in a raspy voice through the respirator as they turned around brandishing a syringe and what looked like a flare. I tried to move away but my entire body was bound to the chair.

"Now, to make sure you don't die I'm going to give you this." They held up the syringe before injecting me. "It will make sure you don't cannibalize yourself as the gas works. I think, haven't tested it yet."

I tried speaking only to realize that I was gagged. _Why hadn't I tried earlier?_ "Oh, yeah don't try speaking. The less I know about you the better and I also need you not to bite your tongue off as the change happens." The stranger then changed the filters in the respirator before lighting the flare and sitting down in a chair. "Experiment Number 234. Attempt 9. This time the subject has been fully restrained and emergency abort is on hand and ready. Now lets truly see if it's the spores or the fog."

**recovered tapes from the extraction missions**

"This is Extraction Team 6, we found something."
"Go ahead 6."
"It looks to be some sort of testing room. Lots of tools everywhere with a chair made to restrain someone in the middle of the room."
"Is there anyone in the room or chair?"
"No. There is lots of blood everywhere though."
_distantly_ "Captain, look at this."
"Nexus, we found something disturbing. The look like plans to mutate people using harvested [[Nightsroft]] and making it a gas."
"6, get out of there now."
"On it. Wait, what is that?"
_gunfire_
"SHIT SHIT SHIT"
_more gunfire and screams_
"YOU ARE GOING TO DIE FOR THAT"
