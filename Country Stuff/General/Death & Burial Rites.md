# Traditional
- Body and bones are burned then the ash is 
	- turned into jewelry to keep them tied to the living
		- Few families go the jewelry route
	- Spread around to make the trip with [[Gods#Vitis|Vitis]] easier
# New Age
- Skin is stripped from the bone and burned
- Bones are then given back to the family to do as they wish
	- Most decorate the bones with flowers or markings of some kind
	- Some families display the bones as a statue in a case
		- often with some sort of epitaph and praise to [[Gods#Vitis|Vitis]]
