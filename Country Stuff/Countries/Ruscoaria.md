# Architecture
Ruscoaria is a country that built on top of a dying one. A city with 3 major levels and 3 minor ones for each major level. The top level has lots of craftsman style buildings with some deconstructivism style buildings. The second level is more Art Deco styled with lots of High and Bio tech. At the lowest layer is the "scum" as the people on the first layer call them. These are those who aren't as lucky to live in the 2nd layer and often do the more "unsavory" things to stay alive

# Society
Being built on a dying city. The top level is designed around wealth and accomplishment that comes with being rich. The second level is where the middle/working class live and go to their everyday jobs. The lowest layer is a mix between industrial, baroque, and gothic styles, although most are in some form of disrepair.
Each layer also has its own set of values. The first layer focusing on wealth, control, order, and accomplishment. The second layer pulls a bit from the first with a focus on efficiency, expertise, hard work, and mastery. The lowest layer pulls very few from the second, holding the values of sustainability, obedience, certainty, decisiveness, and self-reliance.
In addition while it is possible to better yourself and rise in the layers, its very hard and most don't rise beyond the second layer or beyond a few levels in their current layer.
Other than the layer system, most other things are accepted and not even considered when it comes to everyday norms. A partial exception to that is marriage. The upper layers value [[Marriage Customs#True Marriage|True Marriage]] as the only form of marriage. The lower layers tend to favor [[Marriage Customs#Bodily Marriage|Bodily Marriage]] though. The other exception is death. The upper layers steeped in tradition opt for [[Death & Burial Rites#Traditional|traditional]] burials while the other layers lean toward the [[Death & Burial Rites#New Age|new age]] burial methods.
# Government
The government is[[Government#Heavily Eroded| not as strong as it should be]]. While power lies with an [[Government#Oligarchy|oligarchy]] and is mostly [[Government#Decentralized|decentralized]], that power can be easily bought and this has led to an "Obey or Die" mentality.
## Voting
There aren't too many voting opportunities when it comes to the government. Occationally the "leader" will be "removed" or die and there will be an election to choose a new one. However all the candidates are always picked by the [[Government#Oligarchy|oligarchy]] and the ones that aren't always either loose are die before the election.
# Terrain + Mapping
Ruscoaria is mostly flatland with the exception of the capitol as a hub of trains stops/stations and home of major skyscrapers 
### Transportation and Communication
Travel across the country takes a few hours by train via the [[Transport Line]] with the only other alternative being driving or walking, taking a few days or weeks respectively.
When it comes to traveling to other countries the only other method besides the [[Transport Line]] is [[Ocean Travel]]
###  Zone Mapping
Ruscoaria zones are drawn based on population density. Despite population fluctuations the zones have remained the same and led to the vertical divide based on class. This has led to the zone map being a simple formality that isn't looked at, used, or updated
## Economy
### Trade
Trade is often tech and weapons. Most being exported with imports of raw materials, with main drivers of trade being large conglomerates like [[Cruxolutions]]
