# Architecture
Choosing to live in harmony with the forest rather than cutting it down to make space for buildings, they turned the trees into buildings. As the massive oak trees rise high into the sky and form a dense canopy, the Mycolians carved into the trees and built bridges and walk ways between them. From the sky a small clearing can be seen where the did cut down a few trees to fund their efforts but it is the only hole in the canopy.
# Government
The government is very [[Government#Strict|strict]] with its power being given to it by [[Government#Tradition|tradition]]. The leader changes only once they die. If a new one is not picked then those who wish to be leader must make it to the top of the canopy before sundown. If a leader is picked prior to death, that leader must prove his worth over the coming months.
## Voting
There aren't elections in Mycologia in the traditional sense. Every leader is required to have 2 heirs and when the leader dies or steps down the citizens pick which of the heirs they want to lead them. This is often left to be decided by ritual combat but occasionally is decided by who has the most followers.
## Isolationism
After the first outbreak of [[Nightsroft]], Mycologia isolated themselves from the world. Since then they have grown more and more distrusting of the outside world and their ideas. This has also led to them having a deep hatred of major corporations like [[Cruxolutions]] and [[Relmera]], actively disrupting any attempt for them to build anything that is remotely close to their territory.
This has led to many encounters with not only [[Cruxolutions]] but also the power companies. [[Telpenten]] constantly has run ins with them due to maintenance work on the boarder. [[Apoll-etric]] and [[Poetre]]have had a few run ins while helping install powerlines with [[Telpenten]]
# Society
With most ideas being rooted in tradition, change is slow. For example advancing beyond where you were born into bigger and better things is frowned upon because everyone has a role to fill and to abandon yours is to leave the collective to suffer.
In addition things like equal marriage are only partially excepted. If you are a woman or able to give birth, a relationship that doesn't promote that is frowned upon. With these expectations [[Marriage Customs#Soul Marriage|Soul Marriage]] is seen as the only option. 
While marriage is limiting, death only has one option and that is a [[Death & Burial Rites#Traditional|traditional]] burial.
# Terrain + Mapping
With many dense and thick forest, the land is ripe for any logging empitre to get a foot hold. Made up of 4 different forest that all grown and intertwine with each other the entire country is covered in tree cover and branches.
### Transportation and Communication
Transport is done through mainly walking. Communication follows the route of carrier bird and or projectiles if the distance is short enough, this depends on someone's skill though.
