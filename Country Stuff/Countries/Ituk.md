The zones originally were meant to be mapped based on elevation, however it was later rezoned based on how far from the center they are.

## Economy
### Trade
Trade mostly consist of raw materials as an export with imports being tech and weapons. Most of the weapons that are in the country do enter through means of smuggling though.
