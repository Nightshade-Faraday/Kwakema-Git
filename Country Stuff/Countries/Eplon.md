The country of broadcasting and entertainment. Very bright and pretty lights with just as dark and ugly shadows.

Currencies: [[Currencies#Gears|Gears]]
# Architecture
The country is lined to the boarder in buildings. The hot spots are based around some form of broadcast and then surrounded by the specialized type of entertainment. 2 of the biggest being radio and tv broadcasting. Most buildings are in the style of Art Deco with the most expensive and largest building incorporating some High Teck
# Government
The government is a [[Government#Polyarchy|council]] of people elected by each hot spot. This has led to a constantly shifting set up of who is on the council. 
## Censorship
### The Censorship Board
The Censorship Board was officially created to deal with any information about the [[Outbreak]] and its [[Outbreak Events|events]]. They were to obscure anything that would cause panic and replace it with misinformation.
### Nightshroft and Cybernira
Despite made up a a council of people of constantly changing beliefs, the government has a history of censoring anything that might make the production of content harder or might pull the publics attention away from the studios. The most notable event of censorship was during the first outbreak of [[Nightsroft]] and [[Cybernira]].
As information came out on how the disease affected people, the government redacted key information from flyers mailed to people and posted around. In addition the news agencies owned by any studio only reported on the most basic of information and fired anyone who spoke about anything more. Even small news agencies and blogs were taken down upon government order
## Voting
Eplon has a unique way of voting. Elections are a true popularity contest and the winner then has to make sure to keep the publics favor as to also keep their position. This has led to many council members censoring and erasing anything negative about them. In addition the threat of [[Nightsroft]] and [[Cybernira]] made the use of censorship standard.
# Society
Everyone tries to be the best and most likeable when in pubic. Anything that could reflect badly on them is kept behind closed doors. This often means that if someone doesn't like something or thinks something can ruin someone else then they usually try to use it against them somehow. This often lead to many going the route of a [[Marriage Customs#True Marriage|True Marriage]] to prevent a spouse from spilling all the secrets and running.
# Terrain + Mapping
Eplon is very flat and sits below sea level slightly. This has led to many dams and water diversion methods being put in place to prevent flooding
#### Transportation and Communication
90% of transportation is done by trains made by [[Cruxolutions]] with the rest being served by cars or walking
### Zone Mapping
The zones are based on an old drawing the separated the country in circular disc for each level of influence and class. The modern version has 6 zones and districts in each zone with the most influential in the middle of the country.
## Economy
### Trade
Trade often comes in the form of entertainment rights and education. Being the hub of it all it has allowed for many very shaky relationships making trade disputes common
