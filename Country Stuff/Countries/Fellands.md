Currency: [[Currencies#Gears|Gears]], [[Currencies#Etho|Etho]]
# Sub-Countries
## Lithos
(Lee-thos)
Lithos was the northern half the country full of lots of forested areas with small clearings in between. After the [[outbreak]] and during erection of [[Outbreak Events#Walls|the walls]], all the forest and vegetation was destroyed with a mix of air dropped herbicides and ground troop burns.
## Fucrus
(Foo-crus)
Fucrus was the southern half the country that was full of plains and hills. After the [[outbreak]] and during erection of [[Outbreak Events#Walls|the walls]], ground troops were dispatched to burn away all the vegetation and leave nothing but charred dirt behind. Once the burns were complete and troops were moved to Lithos the entire area was been sectioned off and named the Balvera Dead Zone.
# Architecture
Architecture is mostly overgrown ruins. Cities no longer have towers or skyscrapers. Nothing goes too high above the ground due to the corruption and growth. With the loss of the ability to go up, everything spread out across the ground making for large compounds and sprawling cities and towns. 
The only exception are the walls. 22m (72.18ft) thick and 46m (150.9ft) tall, the outside walls protect the world from the terrible disease within. In addition the sector walls, standing at 300m (984.3ft) tall and 15m (49.21ft) thick, separate the Fellands into areas based on [[Nightsroft]] growth.
Near the epicenter of the [[Outbreak]] are a series of spikes and walls. These all incorporate the use of [nuclear semiotics](https://youtu.be/eZVIcl3YGAo?si=lAzEzxo0EmIbbZGs). The spikes emanate for 30 meters from the epicenter. Along the spikes are plaques with written and illustrated warning information.
# Government
With the remaining government being made of survivors and those who refused to leave, its very [[Government#Decentralized|decentralized]]. Power lies with those who represent a group. No true laws, just social curtesy and helping for everyone's benefit
## Voting
With there being so little government voting is often handled on a settlement by settlement basis. Each settlement has its own "government" and will elect people to make decisions for the good of the settlement.
# Society
With the decentralized power and near anarchy, there are lots of different factions. These factions have their own rules and ideologies, but they all tend to do what is needed to survive regardless of your beliefs. 
Marriage isn't a common event however most who do opt for marriage go for a [[Marriage Customs#Bodily Marriage|Bodily Mairriage]] for flexibility.
## Factions
There are many factions across the Fellands. Many claiming territory and maps of said territory often conflicting with and overlapping with other factions territory. Of the most notable ones are the [[Healers of the Twilight]], [[Religious Institutions#Fellands New Life Cult|Fellands New Life Cult]], [[Protectors of the Old Land]], and the [[Rangers of the New Sight]] .
# Terrain + Mapping
The Fellands is mostly plains with small sections of forest. This goes all the way until the exclusion zone where [[Nightsroft]] and [[Cybernira]] have taken the landscape and turned it into a barren mess. Despite this, [[Nightsroft]] exist all throughout the country in much smaller amounts
### Transportation and Communication
Transportation is done only through trains and protected vehicles. It was found out early on that it was the best way to prevent [[Cybernira]] from breaking down the vehicle and allowing [[Nightsroft]] to affect supplies
## Economy
### Trade
Trade mostly consist of raw materials, food, medicine and weapons. With most outside trade routes cut off, everything is done through very meticulously planned airdrops to bring good into the country. Beyond the airdrops everything is made and traded within the country.
