# Pre Expansion
After the death of [[Belladonna Faraday]] the Faraday family began to wield their wealth and power to corner markets and push out competitors leading to the birth of [[Cruxolutions#Astraveel|Astraveel]].
# Post Expansion
During and after [[The Expansion]] the Faraday Family used their overwhelming control through [[Cruxolutions#Astraveel|Astraveel]] to make the production of any non official [[Hyperlanes]] illegal and then used that lack of production to make sure the [[The Rings#Far Outer Ring|Far Outer Ring]] remains under devloped.
