Johnathan Bertan is the brother to [[Michal Bertan]]. Just like his brother he is intelligent, shady and manipulative. Also like his brother he hates being lied to and would rather not deal with [[Cruxolutions]], [[Verdanta]], or the [[Ruscoaria]] government. Despite him and his brother acting all powerful, they both could easily be put in jail and their empire toppled.
