Asta is [[Forced Evolution Viruses#Anomaly 002|Anomaly 002]] from the [[Forced Evolution Viruses|Forced Evolution Virus]] project. After escaping ey survived by scavenging food and sleeping behind or between buildings before a local of the [[The Rings#Far Outer Ring|Far Outer Ring]] took pity on em and gave em a place to stay. Due to eir participation in the [[Forced Evolution Viruses|FEV]] project and eir unique survival circumstances, ey have gained the ability to shapeshift and thus have a pretty big appetite which lead to em snacking a bunch. Another side effect of eir past is a general distruct of people and a hatred of crowds further amplifying eir preexisting introverted nature
