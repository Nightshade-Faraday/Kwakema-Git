Before the expansion the [[Bertan Brothers]] created a bank under the same name. This bank quickly grew due to their low interest rates and high loan output. Once they had a chokehold on [[Ituk]] they began raising rates and buying other banks
# Post Expansion
After [[The Expansion]] the [[Bertan Brothers]] used their power from [[Ituk]] to buy other banks and put them in the position they hold in the [[The Rings#Far Outer Ring|Far Outer Ring]].
