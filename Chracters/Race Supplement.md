# Mechanica
Mechanica are sentient robots who live and act just like humans. With the ability to breath, eat, and bleed like normal people they are indistinguishable from a human unless killed and autopsied.
Mechanica are also called bolted boxes and glorified microwave, used as a slurs.
## History
Mechanica came about when [[Relmera]] debuted their "Happy Helper" Robot. It was a robot servant that was supposed to help you do anything you didn't want to do. Unfortunately for [[Relmera]] they made them too sentient and they soon banded together to fight for their own rights.
