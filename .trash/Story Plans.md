# Main
## Arc 1
Players investigate a small section of [[Fellands]] passing through [[Mycologia]]. The group they are working with, (name here), is working with a lab. (name here), owned by [[Cruxolutions]].

Eventually players should investigate [[Cruxolutions]] and find the company owns several labs and those labs are working on several inhuman projects and are also the cause of both [[Nightsroft]] and [[Cybernira]].

## Arc 2
With the reveal to of [[Cruxolutions]]' power and control. They begin the second round of plagues and start to position themselves as the almighty controller

Players should try and disrupt the plans as much as possible. If they succeed then 1 or 2 countries should be spared while the rest fall under a false theocracy under the control of [[Cruxolutions]]

Race persecution. Changelings, Fae/Fae aligned, Non fighting/magic classes

## Arc 3
Having lost most of the world, the player should unite the remaining countries and take down [[Cruxolutions]]. They could also do this themselves which would give them the option to just usurp [[Belladonna Faraday|Belladonna's]] power.

3 proposed endings. Nuke, Usurp, Restore
- Nuke: All affected countries are purged and turned into a wasteland forcing [[Nightsroft]] and [[Cybernira]] to adapt while most of their host are killed
- Usurp: Power is taken from [[Belladonna Faraday]] and [[Cruxolutions]] and everything they controlled is now the parties 
- Restore: Begin saving everyone and trying to find a way to reverse the effects of [[Nightsroft]] and/or [[Cybernira]] while restoring the countries to something resembling what they were in arc 1
