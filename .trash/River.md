# `=this.subclass` Traits:
Gloom Stalkers are at home in the darkest places: deep under the earth, in gloomy alleyways, in primeval forests, and wherever else the light dims. Most folk enter such places with trepidation, but a Gloom Stalker ventures boldly into the darkness, seeking to ambush threats before they can reach the broader world. Such rangers are often found in the Underdark, but they will go any place where evil lurks in the shadows.

## Dread Ambusher
At 3rd level, you master the art of the ambush. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier.

At the start of your first turn of each combat, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. If you take the [Attack](https://5e.tools/actions.html#attack_phb) action on that turn, you can make one additional weapon attack as part of that action. If that attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon's damage type.

## Umbral Sight
At 3rd level, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision from your race, its range increases by 30 feet.

You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on darkvision. While in darkness, you are [invisible](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#invisible_phb) to any creature that relies on darkvision to see you in that darkness.

## Primeval Awareness
Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number.

# Physical Appearance
[Reference Used](https://vasiliykovpak.artstation.com/projects/LzPql)
[[vasiliy-kovpak-7-charactres-2.jpg|direct image]]
Even though they are a changeling, River's form tends to stay the same. At 5'6" they have dark chocolate skin with steel blue eyes. They have hair is Prussian blue with blackberry highlights. 

Their normal style of dress is a combat suit that covers their entire body along with knee high boots and a pair of gloves. Over the suit are parts an exo-suit covered by a cloak with 2 pouches. Last is their gas mask covering half of her face.

# Background
River grew up at the start of the plagues. Their parents were part the first to try and evacuate but were stopped by their collogues, "Our work is not done" they said. This led to them being placed in the care of their grandparents. Once the plagues reached their peaks and the deaths were at the highest, River left their grandparents to find their parents and get them out. At this point the [[Ruscoaria]] military came in and began turning everything to ash. However they were soon over whelmed and the walls were built.

# Personality
River is a very kind and loving person once someone gets to known them. However upon first meeting, they are very happy and bubbly, its all a mask but its so practiced that only 1 person have been able to see through it. They are very resourceful and loyal to a fault.

## Other parts
- Bubbly
- Friendly
- Vive like
