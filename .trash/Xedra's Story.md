The day the outbreak stated was a normal day. Xedra woke up, got ready for school, said bye to their family as the they left and began the day. It was only when they got home that they knew anything went wrong.

As they entered the house the air was tense. everyone was sitting around the table looking at Xedra's dad, Marcus. Once Xedra sat down he took a deep breath and sighed.

"I can't tell you too much but you deserve to know. Earlier today at the labs we had a containment breach. The severity is unknown but everyone is bracing for an evacuation. The public will be kept in the dark to minimize any panic that could come about, but all the staff are telling their families just in case an evacuation is ordered." 

The news left everyone speechless. A containment breach could spell disaster, yet they weren't telling anyone. For the next few months everything continued on as normal. The only change being Marucs working longer and longer hours.

--------------------------------------------------------

Then everything wasn't fine. Apparently [[Verdanta]] couldn't contain it and it began to spread out of control. First Xedra's mom got sick then some [[Verdanta]] officials came and took them all to a quarantine facility. Inside looked like a lab the was modified to hold possible infected. Xedra and her brother were put into traditional holding cells while they took their mother to somewhere else.

A few days later Xedra's dad came in with an update. 

"We couldn't contain it. I mutated too fast and then got into the animals and other projects. The plan is to quarantine anyone who has had any contact with the infected and then evacuate the staff. They brought in some people to help with quarantining the area and the plan is to bring in the military to cleanse it." Marcus spoke in a somber tone as he sat on a stool on the other side of the steel bars.

"What about us. You said they were going to evacuate staff but mentioned nothing about the families" Xedra asked concerned. 

"There are no guaranties that the staff families haven't been infected so all of them are being quarantined" Marcus explained in the same somber tone

"So you're going to just fuckin leave us? WHAT THE HELL DAD!" Xedra's brother John barked

"I'm sorry but this is what must be done. If you're infected and get out there then.... you don't want to see what I saw." Marcus explained. 

Before they could say anything else, Marcus got up and left. As he walked down the hallway out of the holding wing John shouting at him to come back and how he is a coward for leaving them to die. He only stopped when the sound of the heavy metal door signified that their dad was no longer there and that the two of them were all alone.

--------------------------------------------------------

It has been 2 months since Xedra and John last saw their dad. The only people they saw were the soldiers tasked with watching them for any symptoms. After the first few weeks they were given a dog to look after. Xedra took an immediately liking to it, naming it Roosevelt and their mood improved a bit over the next few day. John however seemed to begin to deteriorate more than he already had. After the staff were evacuated he went silent. Only speaking to Xedra. Now with the dog he wasn't eating or speaking anymore.

After a few more days they both were taken to quarantine as John began showing symptoms of infection. Xedra was kept with the dog and used to test vaccines. The vaccine testing quickly moved from trying to make them immune to trying to cure them as both Xedra and Roosevelt. As the infection progressed it was found to be a rare mutation of [[Nightsroft]], this mutation would allow Xedra to coexist with the other infected however their body would act similar to a blossom. Roosevelt became was infected with both [[Nightsroft]] and [[Cybernira]]. This led to him becoming a variant. 

The day of the break out began like normal until sirens started going off. Soldiers started running around and lots of shooting and shouting was heard. When Xedra woke up there was a Solider standing outside their cell firing at something he didn't last long and once he ran out of ammo he was quickly consumed by a charger. Xedra and Roosevelt both made a quick escape out of the facility and into the waste land.

--------------------------------------------------------
Xedra quickly adapted to the outside and so did Roosevelt. They set up in an abandoned garage and relied on looted food and left over materials to survive. The creation of the zones via inner walls being added made things difficult at times but they both managed.
