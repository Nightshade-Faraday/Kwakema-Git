The Healers of the Twilight is a large cult located in the [[Fellands]]. It holds only 1 leader who possesses a great amount of power. With a great number of followers it is classified as its own faction by the [[Ruscoaria]] government.
# Leader
The leader of the cult is very detached from everything. When approached they responded with kindness unless they are provoked. A sniper observed that when they believe they are alone their face drops to an expressionless mask.
In addition they seem to harness the power of [[Cybernira]] to fight and defend themself in combat while using [[Nightsroft]] for medical purposes. This dual usage seems to put them nearly on the level as a god in their ability to survive almost anything.
# Members
Most members have been noted to not be hostile on first meet, however upon antagonizing the leader or bringing harm to a member the entire group becomes hostile and often deadly.
