Ship Ports are massive structures with a [[Ship Docks|Ship Dock]] and some sort of [[Hyperlanes|Hyperlane]] connection.

# Home Ring
The [[The Rings#Home Ring|Home Ring]] has the most "posh" ship ports. Most of the restaurants use premium ingredients and have very expensive dishes on the menu most times.
# Mid Ring
The [[The Rings#Mid Ring|Mid Ring]] is more sensible when it comes to the food it provides and near the edge has a few ports that lack a connection to the [[Hyperlanes]].
# Far Outer Ring
The Far Outer Ring has the cheapest food and the ports rarely have a [[Hyperlanes|Hyperlane]] connection. To travel between there is a similar system to the [[Hyperlanes]] however it is slower and tends to be experimental.
