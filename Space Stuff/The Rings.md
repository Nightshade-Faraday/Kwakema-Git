The Rings are the major separator for the galaxy and are _mostly_ under the rule of the Galactic Council of Kwakema.
# Home Ring
The home ring is the first set of planets that surround the home world. Kwakema and its moons. This section was the breeding ground for [[The Expansion]] and is one of the easier places to live of the 3 rings.
# Mid Ring
The mid ring is the buffer zone between the "lawless land" that is the Far Outer ring. Living here is most akin to living in [[Ruscoaria#Society|Ruscoaria's second layer]] as everyone is trying to move forward and up and everyone is working towards bigger and better things.
# Far Outer Ring
The Far Outer Ring is the farthest area from Kwakema. Despite what the GC says, the Far Outer Ring is run by the companies and houses that do business there. Often deemed the "lawless land" due to the near hands off method of control the council of houses uses.
