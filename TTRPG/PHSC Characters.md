Hera is an engineer who used to work for [[Verdanta]] before they were abandoned in the [[Fellands]] after getting separated from their group. With no way out, for the past 7 years they have been helping the animals affected by [[Cybernira]] by repairing them or making modifications to their bodies to make their lives easier. After 7 years Hera has helped so many of the [[Cybernira#Small Animals|animals]] affected by [[Cybernira]] that even the ones who haven't been helped trust her.
Hera has also been modifying their spinal implant to work with her pet wolf who found them early on after being abandoned. The modifications would allow for the wolf to merge with Hera giving them [[Augments#Cybernetic|cybernetic]] tail, ears, and claws.
## Rafi
- He/Him
- Cis-man
- Personality
	- Flamboyant
	- Bubbly
Rafi is a streamer and content creator. He is also a registered guide and partnered with [[Relmera]]. Rafi has had a rough time living in [[Eplon]] due to the heavy [[Eplon#Censorship|censorship]] and the constantly shifting taste of the public. He's spent most of his time grinding and working his way up the ladder. 
When it comes to making things move faster and getting the party things they need, Rafi is very good at it. Having a host of connections and favors owed to him he holds more than enough power to be part of the [[Eplon#Government|Eplon government]]. This does mean that at times he can be manipulative and when he needs people to do things for him he often slips into those habits.
