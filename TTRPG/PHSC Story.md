# Recovery
Takes place a few years after the [[Outbreak]] but several years before [[PHSC Story#Tarnishing Grace|Tarnishing Grace]]. Thus [[Exo-Suits]] are still a sort of new thing and people being cleared to use them is a big deal. The year 2110 would fit for characters ages if they move on to [[PHSC Story#Tarnishing Grace|Tarnishing Grace]].
The [[Fellands]] have been evacuated and walled but not fully mapped. The party is one of 18 task forces sent in to map out the area. Their job is mostly to turn on the [[Atalanta System]]. A series of towers that were used for communication and now to map out the new landscape
### Chapter 1 - Deployment
The one-shot starts with the party being forced into contracts where they are required to head to the [[Fellands]] to help fill out the map. Once they agree they are fitted into [[Exo-Suits]] and loaded onto a train and taken to the [[Outbreak#Walls|exclusion wall]].

Once on the other side of the wall the party will then slowly make their way to the location. Have them roll a d20 and then roll a d4 to determine which type of encounter to use.
### Chapter 2 - Discovery
Once at the location the party will run 5 small hold the point missions to active the [[Atalanta System|Atalanta towers]] with the missions being relatively easy.

This uses the same [[Enemy Statblocks]] as Tarnishing Grace does for the [[PHSC Story#The Cavern|cavern area]].

The escape mission will be a long hold the line mission. Make it so they can win but most likely will not.

# Tarnishing Grace
## Arc 1 - Laying Foundations
### Chapter 1 - Introduction
The campaign opens with the party in suspension tanks and barely overhearing a conversation happening outside it.
"What do you mean this is all we have?"
"No, I'm not saying I don't want it. I just-"
"What project were they from? The Mapping Program? I guess that works."
"What version are they?"
"A mix? What do you mean _a mix_?"
"YOU OVERLAYED THE COPIES!! WHY?!"
"You do realize that can lead to the entire [[Cloning|clone]] frying?"
"Fuck it. I'll let you know if they die or are dead."
### The Old Lab
After a bit of silence. The party is drained out of their suspension tanks and dumped out in front of them.
"Welcome back to the real world. Lets get you up to speed on the last 50 years. The [[Fellands]] has been fully mapped out and the practice of cloning has been banned. Now moving on to why you haven't been destroyed. You are still under contract with both [[Verdanta]] and the [[Ruscoaria]] government to execute missions for us. That being said lets get you cleaned and suited up."

The party is then taken to a locker room where they clean up themselves and equip their gear. Afterwards they move to an empty cafeteria with a section cleared for their [[Exo-Suits]].
"Now here is your mission. You will be escorted to the [[Outbreak#Walls|exclusion wall]] and take out the trespassers. My employer would prefer you do it non lethally. I personally don't care."
#### Mission
- Investigate and Eliminate trespassers outside the [[Outbreak#Walls|exclusion wall]]
My employer has noticed an increase in the number of people trespassing at the edge of the exclusion wall. This isn't anything new, however the people who are trespassing are consistent and have started bringing boxes and bags with them. [[Telpenten]] wants you to investigate what they are doing and eliminate them if needed. Upon completion they will pay you in [[Currencies#Gears|gears]] based on job satisfaction.
### The Wall
#### The Journey
Upon leaving the bar the party then makes their way to the wall. The journey is meant for them to get to know each other.
Avoid combat please
#### The Exclusion Wall
After reaching the [[Outbreak#Walls|exclusion wall]] the party begins searching for the trespassers. After a bit of searching they find them.
- Best outcome is to reason with them
	- If they choose the reason. 
		- The [[Enemy Statblocks#Trespassers|trespassers]] explain their cause to the party. The [[Fellands]] has several dozen settlements inside it and many of them are struggling to become or stay self sufficient. These shipments (they gesture to the crate behind them) are crucial to helping them become self sufficient or keep them from collapsing.
- Expected outcome is a fight
	- If they fight. ([[Wall Fight.png|battle map]])
		- The trespassers flee leaving the crate and firing several flares and smoke grenades to cover their tracks.

##### Warning
After dealing with the trespassers the party will meet [[PHSC Characters#Henri Shelish Henri|Henri]] where give them a warning about who they trust. 
Not everyone here is looking out for how things will turn out for you. Especially [[Xedra Phaladeri|Phaladeri]], be careful accepting anything from him. You never know if you are the user, the experiment, the product, or the weapon.

### Chapter 2 - The Lost Ones
#### The Return
[[PHSC Characters#Henri Shelish Henri|Henri]] then disappears back into the wall and the party then returns to [[Ruscoaria]] to meet up with the [[TTRPG/Characters#Howl|informant]] who they learn is named [[PHSC Characters#Abram|Abram]]. [[PHSC Characters#Abram|Abram]] is now dressed in a long, flowy, slightly sheer, white dress. She then gives the party a new task mission from [[Verdanta]].
##### Mission
 - Retrieve old tech from the [[Fellands]]
 It appears that I've been reassigned to give you missions and be your sort of eye in the skies. That being said, [[Verdanta]] has issued a new mission that I think y'all might like. They want you to into the [[Fellands]] and retrieve some old tech. I'm not sure what they mean by old tech, but they gave coordinates to where they want you to go so I assume its there. I'll get more information if you accept the mission.
#### Old Tech
After accepting the mission and returning to the [[Fellands]], the party will have to make their way to one of the old labs. Along the way they will meet [[PHSC Characters#Hera|Hera]] and one of the major groups in the [[Fellands]]. Roll a d4 to decide.
- [[Protectors of the Old Land]]
- [[Rangers of the New Sight]]
- [[Healers of the Twilight]]
- [[Religious Institutions#Fellands New Life Cult|Fellands New Life Cult]]
After interacting with one of the groups the party will receive a check in from both [[PHSC Characters#Abram|Abram]] and a [[Verdanta]] employee. This is done 3 times throughout the whole trip. Once at the start, again after meeting one of the major groups, then a final time at the lab.
Upon reaching the lab the party will discover a massive hole the goes deep underground with lots of [[Nightsroft]] and [[Cybernira]] "growing" from it.[[PHSC Characters#Abram|Abram]] will then give the order to return to [[Ruscoaria]] so they can properly prepare before heading inside the hole (much to the distaste of the [[Verdanta]] representative)
#### Gear up
Upon reaching [[Ruscoaria]] the party will meet with [[PHSC Characters#Abram|Abram]] and a [[Verdanta]] representative who is wearing a mask. There everyone will be updated on changes that have been made to the mission.
##### Mission Update
- Venture into the cavern and retrieve the source of the outbreak. Failure is not an option.
That cavern you saw is ground zero. You need to venture into it and retrieve the source of the outbreak. This mission has been offered to you and only you through secure channels. Should you fail to retrieve the source you will be blacklisted from buy, working with, or interacting with anything owned by [[Verdanta]], its subsidiaries, and partners.
#### The Cavern
Upon returning to the cavern with an updated mission the party will head underground and fight their way to the source of the outbreak. Along the way they will encounter everything from normal infected and fanatics to much harder versions of the [[Cybernira#Sentients|Sentients]] they found above ground.
##### Inside
Many of the enemies are the same as above ground. People now lost to an infection who's only goal is to consume. However, the strong and more _[[Enemy Statblocks#The Cavern|advanced enemies]]_ are wearing first generation [[Plug-Suits|Plug]] and [[Exo-Suits]] with a very very very small few having even more modern ones. ([[Cave.png|battle map]])
It seems that outside of those who were lost at ground zero, the party wasn't the first to attempt this mission. As the party goes deeper they find that they seem to be far from the first to attempt this mission.
###### Hidden Rooms
There are 3 hidden rooms in the cavern. 2 of them seem to have fallen in while the third looks to have been cut and pasted down there.
- Room 1
	- An old storage room with diagrams of different fungi
- Room 2
	- What was once a lab with many machines now taken over completely by [[Cybernira]]. There seem to be a few computers in the very back
- Room 3
	- [[Tapes of the Lost]]
		- A series of tapes recorded by a distressed scientist
		- Along the wall scrawled in blood "THERE IS NO DISCHARGE IN THE WAR"
	- A locker with an early [[Plug-Suits|plug-suit]] prototype
	- A desk with a cassette player and a series of cassettes

### Chapter 3 - Reassignment
After finding and collecting the "source" the party will return to [[Ruscoaria]] and hand it over to the representative. Upon receiving payment a new mission will be given to them. In order to accept the mission the party will have to travel to [[Eplon]] and meet with the current sitting council.
#### The Trip
The party has to find a way to get to [[Eplon]]. During the trip the party will have the option to get to know each other, work on their [[Exo-Suits]], or even learn about the world around them.
#### [[Eplon]]
Upon reaching [[Eplon]] the party has to make their way to the capital and get a meeting with the council.
- No intended way. Bribe people or just rush in
	- Don't let them kill everyone
##### The Council
Upon meeting with the council the party will be given their first mission.
###### Mission
- Investigate claims of treason and malicious business practices against [[Relmera]]
One of the countries biggest companies, [[Relmera]], has been accused of many malicious practices and even treason. Before they are brought in front of us for a trial we need you to investigate them.
#### The Investigation
_This whole bit is lots of talking with people and trying to convince people to like the party._
During the investigation the party will find out evidence for the following:
- Union Busting
- Skirting Censorship
- Exploiting Labor
- Underground deals
All of this will be found out through several whistleblowers or by talking with the CEO of [[Relmera]] themself. After getting the information the party can return to the council where they can decide to tell the truth or lie to the council members.
- Tell
	- [[Eplon#The Censorship Board|The Censorship Board]] breaks in and arrest all the council members before also arresting the party
- Lie
	- The party needs to pass a difficult check and if they fail the party is arrested under suspicion for treason. If they pass the party is dismissed by the council and [[April Caldera]] calls to meet them
#### Relmera
Upon being dumped into vans and driven to a [[Relmera]] blacksite the party is placed in front of [[April Caldera]].
##### Mission
Well. I should thank you, however I have a new job for you. One of my associates in [[Ituk]] has had a hit put out on them. Now before you ask, all I know is it was on a private channel and the person who warned me is now dead. Find [[Azalea Topamal]] and make sure they live. If you can, also check on [[Erik Todstol]] and [[Mika Rotvol]]. If you see [[Xedra Phaladeri]]. STAY AWAY FROM HIM.
### Chapter 4 - One Last Stop and Another Job
#### Travel
The party is given a few train tickets for them to travel to [[Eplon]]. Along the way [[PHSC Characters#Abram|Abram]] will get back in contact with them and meet them in person with [[PHSC Characters#Hera|Hera]] at the train station.
On the train the party (hopefully) will give [[PHSC Characters#Abram|Abram]] and update on their mission.
#### Ituk
Upon reaching [[Ituk]] the party needs to make their way to [[Poetre]] headquarters. Along the way they will meet both [[Erik Todstol|Erik]] and [[Mika Rotvol|Mika]] who are also trying to get to [[Xedra Phaladeri|Xedra]], but for different reasons (all presenting at the same conference).
Getting to the conference is easy, but getting in is hard and requires the party remove their [[Exo-Suits]] and also convince the guards they are not a threat (at this point in time they are big news because of [[Relmera]]).
#### The Conference
The Conference will open with a presentation from [[Azalea Topamal|Azalea]] and halfway through the presentation a shot will be fired (coin toss hit or miss). [[Azalea Topamal|Azalea]] will survive and the stage will be rushed by what look like security guard with non security guard weapons.
##### Optional Fight
Timed rush fight. ([[rush fight.png|battle map]] and [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcf2qyNnwVA&list=PLs4r3YYOrk5O3losDIFaR9cFicmlWSc3y&index=8))
- Just keep throwing [[Enemy Statblocks#Assualt Crew|enemies]] at them until a timer runs out
	- Timer of 1 min
		- Have them roll a skill check on how sneaky they were
#### The Government
After escaping (or surviving) the fight at the conference the party is arrested and questioned by the government as to why they were there. After the questioning is finished the party is released to [[PHSC Characters#Abram|Abram]] who begins taking them back to [[Ruscoaria]]. Along the way the party gets the chance to talk to [[Azalea Topamal]] and are given blanket use of her products and gives them a voucher for 30 free coffees.
### Chapter 5 - Reassignment Reprise
#### The Return Trip
After the escort back to the train [[PHSC Characters#Abram|Abram]] walks around handing out small envelopes. Inside the envelopes are updated licenses.
"Here are your new licenses. You can now use this upgrade to gain access to one of the new manufactures. I'd recommend one of the ones who have either taken a liking to you or that you've been eyeing."
Upon finishing his spiel, [[PHSC Characters#Abram|Abram]] sits down solemnly before adding
"This also brings to end our partnership. I have been removed from this project and the rest of it dissolved. You might be given someone else to guide you or probably shown how to pull things off the job board. Either way I'm leaving"

#### Back Home?
After a while of silence the train arrives in [[Ruscoaria]] central transit station. The party, [[PHSC Characters#Abram|Abram]], and [[PHSC Characters#Hera|Hera]] all disembark. (The rest of this will be improve based on the parties reactions to [[PHSC Characters#Abram|Abrams]] previous statements)

_The party now can pick a location as a central base from which they will depart form and return to between missions and chapters_
## Arc 2 - The Rise
### Chapter 1 - Bridges Built
Upon arriving at the new base the party is greeted by a mysterious visitor. The person they meet is [[TTRPG/Characters#Rafi|Rafi]] who introduces himself before giving them a summons to the [[Eplon#Government|Eplon council]].
## Arc 3 - The Decisons
### The Prism Fight - End of Arc 3
### Stage 1
The party walks in on the heads of [[The Prism]] arguing. [[Verdanta]] CEO [[Xedra Phaladeri]], [[Telpenten]] CEO [[Leo Markster]], [[Apoll-etric]] CEO [[Calkora Crestlight]], and [[Poetre]] CEO [[Azalea Topamal]]. All sat around a table arguing about the future of [[The Prism]].
The part will be noticed by [[Xedra Phaladeri|Xedra]] first and quickly pull out a gun and shoot the other CEO's before pushing a button. This button begins a fight with a bunch of [[Mech Flavoring|Horus]] frames while [[Xedra Phaladeri|Xedra]] escapes.

### Stage 2
Cue Song: [Mangle Boss Fight Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUtkO_G_XGQ)
Once all the [[Mech Flavoring|Horus]] frames are destroyed and [[Xedra Phaladeri|Xedra]] is long gone, an alarm goes off. Lights begin flashing and alarms are blaring as the buildings shaking becomes significantly more violent. [[Calkora Crestlight]] pulls herself up from the ground and addresses the party one last time before collapsing.
Gravely voice: "You shouldn't have come here."
Automated Voice: "Project 4873-K4 has breached containment. Evacuate the facility immediately."
2 Options
- Run
	- Has chance of getting caught and causing fight
- Fight
Fight Song: [JR's The Mangle Unused](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9HL9PgZrY8)
### Stage 3
After getting caught (or staying to fight) the party comes face to face with Project 4873-K4. An amalgam of [[Nightsroft]] and [[Cybernira]] piloting a mass of different [[Exo-Suits|Exo-Suit]] parts.
- After the party gets a good look at it they all must make a difficult save as it pulls out a gun(?) and shoots them. The party is electrocuted and all of them drop dead or pass out ([music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AShvr9JU9YM&pp=ygUcZW50cmFuY2UgdG8gdGhlIHNjYXJsZXQgdm9pZA%3D%3D))
	- Dead
		- Afterlife scene plays out and then just after everyone gets their scene they are all revived
			- The fight starts
	- Pass Out
		- No special scene, they stumble to their feet and get ready to fight
			- The fight starts
## Side
### Progression
- During the campaign have [[The Prism]] slowly get built more and more
	- Have news paper headlines about it or news reports
### Music
- Music from horror games could make for good fight/chase music
- Artist to use
	- 2EWI
# Moonfall
## Arc 1 - Defrost
### Chapter 1 - Welcome to your New Home
It campaign opens with a wide shot of the [[Canevery Space Station]] in orbit as a package is fired up to it via the [[Coovery Railgun]]. Narrowly being missed by the package is the party approaching the [[Canevery Space Station|station]] in a boarding pod.
### The Simulation
They are welcomed on by an [[Cruxolutions#Astraveel|Astraveel]] representative who explains they have been brought on to test the new [[Space Mechs|space mechs]]. The party is then brought to the simulation room and taught how to use the new mechs.
#### Mission
- Destroy the targets
For this all you need to do is destroy all the targets. Its jut so you can get used to movement and your weapons since these are much bigger than [[Exo-Suits]]. Once you are done I'll give you a tour of the facility.

### The Station
With the simulation complete the party is then given a tour around the station. The tour mostly consist of pointing to boarded windows and locked doors that are labs and some more locked doors that are classified. Upon ending up on the side saved for [[Cruxolutions#Astraveel|Astraveel]] they are pointed to their quarters and told 
"All [[Cruxolutions#Astraveel|Astraveel]] rooms are off-limits to y'all. [[Verdanta]] rooms require prior authorization before you can enter. You will be retrieved at 0500 for more testing." The escort then walked away.

In the quarters is a series of beds lined against a wall with only enough space for a small side table to fit between them. On the farthest wall is a lone door leading a small room that operates as a very basic bathroom. On each bed is a new state of the art [[Space Mechs#Plug-Suits|plug suit]].

### Chapter 2 - Recovery
At 0500 the party is woken up and taken to a launching point where they are given their mission by a [[Cruxolutions#Astraveel|Astraveel]] employee.
#### Mission
- Recover a sample from the nearby moon
We need you to retrieve a sample from the marked point on the map. If you come across anyone who claims to have been sent out by us, kill them. If encounter any hostility, you are allowed to deal with it how you see fit.

### Chapter 3 - The Moon
Upon reaching the moons surface the party will begin the trek toward the marker, along the way passing old equipment and what look to be destroyed mechs.
#### The Voices
One (or more) of the party members will begin hearing voices and depending on some skill checks see visions. This will increase after the party has the sample and the voices will go from single words to full on sentences.
#### The Visions
For the members that begin seeing visions, every vision roll will be a memory on a success and a vision of the future on a fail. The memories will be a mix of past lives and wont all be from the same one.
#### The Guardians
As they are about to reach the pickup location to return to the station, the party will meet The Guardians and a small fight will ensue. The fight can be ignored through running or by reasoning with The Guardians. The music can be any music from ultrakill but must start with [Wildfire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYN1CU3g10g)
### Containment
Upon returning to the station the party is brought to a decontamination station. They are their mechs are then cleaned and stored while the sample is brought to containment. The party is then brought to a room full of chairs, wires, and computers.
## Arc 2 - Shatter
### Chapter 1 - Reset
Once fully in the room it is revealed to the party that they will be reprogramed and have their memories wiped. Any resistance is futile and all attempts to resist will be met with force. However, to give them time to come to terms with their impending reset they will be left alone for 15min.
### Chapter 2 - Alarm
After being alone for 10min out of the 15, an alarm goes off and the a voice comes over the intercom.
"Site wide containment breech. Main power compromised, auxiliary power at 15%. Evacuate Immediately."
The lights in the room then switch to a eerie red and screaming is immediate heard from the other side of the door. The door remains locked however, leaving the party trapped.
#### The Door
The door can be opened 2 ways
- Hacking
	- Hacking the door is a simple check that will be counted with difficulty depending on how stressed the character is
- Shorting
	- Shorting the door is a risky check that if failed will electrocute the character attempting to short it out.
### Escape
The party now must escape the station. The escape pods are on the exact opposite side with the launching bay where their mechs and other transport vehicles are. In between them is The Subject, dozens of bodies, panicked scientist, and several guards. 
#### Fighting
All fights will be contained to a single hallway section with the party having to traverse 15 left or right scenarios (see [[flow chart]]).
#### Running
Running is just traveling though the [[flow chart]] until the party reaches the launching bay.
#### The Subject
[[Kanaveer#The Subject|The Subject]] will hunt down the party upon first seeing them. The party can out run it by reaching the launching bay before it. However, it is faster than them.
### Chapter 3 - Freedom
At the launching bay the party has 2 options:
#### Leaving in a transport
Leaving in the transport ends the campaign and the station sits abandoned as the grave of many
#### Fight The Subject
Fighting [[Kanaveer#The Subject|The Subject]] ends with it the station self destructing and the party crashing to Kwakema. Depending on how much health the battle ended with (less than 7hp) will determine if they survive the landing. The music will go from the [early unstable high stakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsw-hljTE10) to the later [last stand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XznORTnoQM&list=PLyVy5tNkhxX6lBTfBq90K5Ee21MclRG4g&index=13)
### Chapter 4 - Epilogue
#### Transport
Months after returning from the [[Canevery Space Station|station]] the party is invited to watch as the railgun destroys it and it burns up in the atmosphere. As parts of it fall to the planet some of the sample canisters survive reentry leading to the samples of [[Kanaveer]] becoming exposed.
#### Grenade
Days after the [[Canevery Space Station|station]] exploded, several sample containers were found with holes burned in them.
