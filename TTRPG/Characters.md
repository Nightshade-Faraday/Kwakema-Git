Howl is an informant for hire. Often being hired to pass messages and information back and forth, he often says he's a "glorified messenger". Through the act of doing his job Howl has seen the entire world of Kwakema. From the most pristine of [[Ruscoaria]] and [[Eplon]] to the waste of the [[Fellands]] and the mines of [[Ituk]], even the forest of [[Mycologia]]. Its also through his job that he learned how important anonymity is and thus now always wears a mask and is somewhat distrusting. The lack of trust often makes him seem like an asshole, but he really is a nice person who cares too much when he gets attached.

John is a [[Ruscoaria]] reserve soldier who lives in [[Eplon]] with his younger brother. After serving as part of the [[Ruscoaria]] military for 30 years and being the leader of the one of the task forces used to break up some of the [[Timeline|Fellands Riots]], John was put in reserve so he could begin to have a more peaceful life without going into retirement just yet.
John is most known for being a kind and caring man with a tank barrel on his back. His [[Exo-Suits|Exo-Suit]] is several layers of hulking metal and shielding with a singular tank barrel mounted to his back. This tank barrel, when deployed, has a series of supports that anchor it and John to the ground. Said ground is then destroyed by the recoil upon firing with the gun and John both being ok.

	- Have them fuse with their pet wolf and then get infected with [[Nightsroft]]
Hera is an engineer who used to work for [[Verdanta]] before they were abandoned in the [[Fellands]] after getting separated from their group. With no way out, for the past 7 years they have been helping the animals affected by [[Cybernira]] by repairing them or making modifications to their bodies to make their lives easier. After 7 years Hera has helped so many of the [[Cybernira#Small Animals|animals]] affected by [[Cybernira]] that even the ones who haven't been helped trust her.
Hera has also been modifying their spinal implant to work with her pet wolf who found them early on after being abandoned. The modifications would allow for the wolf to merge with Hera giving them [[Augments#Cybernetic|cybernetic]] tail, ears, and claws.
## Rafi
- He/Him
- Cis-man
- Personality
	- Flamboyant
	- Bubbly
Rafi is a streamer and content creator. He is also a registered guide and partnered with [[Relmera]]. Rafi has had a rough time living in [[Eplon]] due to the heavy [[Eplon#Censorship|censorship]] and the constantly shifting taste of the public. He's spent most of his time grinding and working his way up the ladder. 
When it comes to making things move faster and getting the party things they need, Rafi is very good at it. Having a host of connections and favors owed to him he holds more than enough power to be part of the [[Eplon#Government|Eplon government]]. This does mean that at times he can be manipulative and when he needs people to do things for him he often slips into those habits.

After getting fished up by some fishermen in the waters of [[Ituk]], she's written off as a regular dead body who was miraculously saved by some god or other. Due to the water damage and the trauma of drowning, a bunch of their memories/data got was corrupted so they don't remember much of why they were created and what lead to the decommission. So they take up the job offer as a way to try and learn more about all of that.
### Plans
Across Arc 2 they will gain access to (or break into) government documents that detail the missions they went on and the things they did. In addition some company documents will have info on her relationships

In order to get access to the files either make it a skill check that has adequate risk (in group session) or a dedicated puzzle (individual session)
