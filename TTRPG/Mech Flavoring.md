- [[TTRPG Systems#System|Lancer]] Mech frames will be re-flavored as [[Exo-Suits]]
- Each frame is its own [[Exo-Suits|exo]]
	- Modifications will be [[Exo-Suits|exo-suit]] mods
- Mech companies will be rolled under one or more of the world companies
	- [[Cruxolutions]] = IPS-Northstar (IPS-N)
	- [[Relmera]] = Smith-Shimano Corpro (SSC)
	- [[Verdanta]] = Horus
	- [[Telpenten]] = Harrison Armory (HA)
	- [[Poetre]] = General Massive Systems (GMS)

idk how to get [[Plug-Suits]] to matter yet (more research needed
