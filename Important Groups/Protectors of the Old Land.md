Located in the [[Fellands]], The Protectors of the Old Land is a group of people who hold the ideas of the former countries [[Fellands#Lithos|Lithos]] and [[Fellands#Fucrus|Fucrus]]. Through the use of force and safety camps they control lots of unconnected land. There have been many attempts to gain control over one of the former countries, however due to the [[Rangers of the New Sight]] those attempts have been thwarted.
