Kanaveer is the name of the species of slime like creatures that were discovered on the moon. [[Verdanta]] would then bring it on board the [[Canevery Space Station]] with the help of [[Cruxolutions#Astraveel|Astraveel]].
# The Experiments
To figure out what the Kanaveer are like and capable of many experiments were ran.
## Stress Test
The stress test experiments consisted of environmental extremes, adaptability, and anatomy examinations. Most of the test yielded little to no results. Often all that was learned was that they are very adapted to living on the moon.
## The Subject
The Subject is an entity that was created when one of the Kanaveer samples broke containment and attached itself to one of the interns. From there more experiments were preformed in an attempt to figure out how Kanaveer and Humans interact biologically.
As the testing progressed the humanity of the intern was lost leaving behind a savage animal that was called "The Subject" by those who knew about it

## Anomaly 002
Anomaly 002 was a dead body that was reborn as a shapeshifter. It is assumed that when it was put in the compacter for disposal, some of the Kanaveer from the other failed subjects entered the body of [[Forced Evolution Viruses#Anomaly 002|Subject-A-4458]] and "mixed together" created the conditions where it could rebuild the damaged body and brain to the point of bringing back a sentient being
