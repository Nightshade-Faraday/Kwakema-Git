Cybernira is a infection disease that is caused by an unknown experiment gone wrong by [[Verdanta]]. The current sectioned off section is on the north western of the Balvera Dead Zone and has been named the Horon Dead Zone
# Infection
When it infects a living entity it slowly consumes them corrupting more and more of them until they are completely a robot/machine
## Small Animals
When things like cats, dogs, and cattle are infected they enter the first of 3 stages
### Stage 1
- They begin to act more lethargic and sleep a lot more
- The infection site begins to loose color
### Stage 2
- The infection site turns necrotic from lack of blood flow.
	- By now its too late as its spread to other parts of the body
- The subject is now in an almost coma state, barely reacting to external stimuli
### Stage 3
- The subjects necrotic skin beings to reveal the mechanical metal beneath. At this point the subject is a poor imitation of the original
- The subject will also occasionally fly into (almost) random rages and try to bite people to spread the infection
## Sentients
Sentients are partially different to small animals in the later stages. The infection seems to know it has infected a sentient being
### Stage 1
- Subject acts more lethargic and sleeps a lot more
	- Some will develop narcolepsy 
### Stage 2
- Infection site begins to look infected
- Subject begins to fall into a coma like state
	- Some subjects can "come out of it" but they seem to carry a variation of the infection
### Stage 3
- Subject starts to visibly look like a robot, starting from the infection site
- Subject no longer acts normal, often just standing still until it notices movement and charges at it
	- Some subjects have a bit of self awareness left and can "snap out of" these states before falling returning later
### Stage 4
- Subject is not fully a machine
- Subject barely imitates its original self and seems to be part of a hive mind
	- This is assumed to be the cause of the random fits of rage/charging at something
# Variants
Only 2 variants have been found. The watchers and the listeners.
## The Watchers
Watchers are the original variant and were the only version known until it was found that they [[Nightsroft]] could be infected. Once infection completes the subject stands still and only moves when it spots movement, promptly charging at it

## The Listeners
Listeners are the variant of the infected [[Nightsroft]] the came about later. They were observed to have "woken up" early from the stage 2 infection state and as a result they loose all their vison. This leaves them to shuffle around and blind race toward any sound they come across

> Addendum
> They seem to have learned to identify some sounds and be able to ignore them. This may also be an affect of the hive mind
