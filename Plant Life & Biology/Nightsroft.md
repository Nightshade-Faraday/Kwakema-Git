Nightsroft is a fungus that grows and consumes. It is located in the Balvera Dead Zone, named after patient zero's last words.
# Spreading
## Spores
Nightsroft spreads through spores emitted from its vines or growth. This is how it spreads and starts new growth and further claim territory. These spores can root in anything from living entities to moss and from there it slowly corrupts and consumes.
## Vines
While the vines also emit spores, that tends to happen when the blossom and their flowers open up. These release spores while the vines themself secrete a venom that infects anything that gets caught in them. This venom infects the entity, turning them into a spore spreader, and poisons them so when they die then can give rise to more Nightsroft

# Inhabitation/Cohabitation
Despite the obvious dangers, many people have moved to live in areas taken over by Nightsroft. Some do it for the freedom and other to escape their crimes. This has led to many settlements across the Balvera Dead Zone. Transportation between them ranges from absolutely none to a system of rails that is guarded from infected by a dedicated firing squad.
