The Forced Evolution Viruses were part of a major project started by [[Cruxolutions#Astraveel|Astraveel]] on the [[Canevery Space Station]]. After the [[Timeline|destruction of the station]] and [[The Expansion]] the project was continued on several different planets and led to the production of 5 different virus types.

# A Series
The A series was the most hack and slash method of making an evolution virus. It consisted of was only [[Kanaveer]] and locking the subject in a room with it. This lead to many failed experiments as most subjects died and those that didn't ended up similar to [[Kanaveer#The Subject|The Subject]].
# B Series
The B series was more refined than the A series due to working off of [[Verdanta]]'s [[Nightsroft]] experiments. The success rate was high but not high enough and many of the subjects ended up devolving into the already know infection variants.
# C Series
The C series, like the B series, also used [[Verdanta]]'s experiments as a base, although this time it was the [[Cybernira]] experiments. With an established base along with the widespread integration of [[Cybernira]] the projects had much more to work with and produced many more successes.
# D Series
The D series was an attempt at mixing the successes seen in the B and C series together. This saw major success despite falling into the same pitfall as the B series and producing already known results. The success was in the ability to maintain the subjects mental capabilities and autonomy in most cases.
## D-289
D-289 was the most extreme stand of the D series. Lacking to same level of retained mental capabilities, stand D-289 was used to test the theory that it could be used as a bio-weapon. This stress test was a success after being performed on a secluded mining rig in the [[The Rings|Far Outer Ring]].

# E Series
The E series took the retained mental capability and autonomy from the E series and the rapid mutation and adaptability of the A series and combined it. This led to the first subject being able to interact with the scientist before the [[Kanaveer]] infection took over.
## E-528
E-528 was the most promising stand of the E series. Many subjects retained most or all mental faculties and were able to continue about their life for about 3-15 months. A stress test was preformed on a series of willing subjects who were able to continue their life as if nothing happened.
