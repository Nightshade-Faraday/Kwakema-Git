Pronounced: Poly- Gl-eye Core- 4- ick acid

The compound that was being researched for the [[Outbreak#Experiments|Nightsroft and Cybernira Experiments]]. The ability of the compound is mostly unknown but the original goal was the combine both human and animalistic features. The hope was to make it customizable for the client they marketed it to.
An infant version of this compound was already created for basic [[Augments#Cybernetic|cyberentic augments]]. As augments progressed another version was developed using mainly [[Cybernira]] as the base.
