# News
Of the many news industries, a few are more well known. Of these the most infamous is Melnare News. This is because of their reporting on [[Nightsroft]] and [[Cybernira]]. Despite other news agencies owned by Relmera doing the bare minimum of censorship, Melnare spent most of the coverage denying the existence of the plague and downplaying its danger and harm. This would soon become a major controversy once other countries started pointing out the misinformation and calling out Melnare and Relmera for using their size and credibility to mislead the public
