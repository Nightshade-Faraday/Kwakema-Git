The Expansion was the rapid development of space technology and travel by [[Cruxolutions#Astraveel|Astraveel]], [[Verdanta#Pixystone Medical|Pixystone Medical]], [[Telpenten]], and [[Apoll-etric]].

## Space Ports
Through the rapid expansion and attempt to dominate the space transit space, [[Cruxolutions#Astraveel|Astraveel]] developed space ports. These ports became hubs for trade, shipping, and manufacturing aided by the Hyperlanes.
## Hyperlanes
The [[Hyperlanes]] were developed at the same time as the Space Ports to help with long distance travel. With the lack of true Faster Than Light (FTL) travel the [[Hyperlanes]] were a much better alternative than long haul travel for months to years on end.
## Ship Docks
The ship docks are a major section of the Space Ports allowing for most of the trade and shipping. The Ship Docks were designed by [[Telpenten]] to be able to double as emergency refuge areas and also shares many of the same design elements as the ship building yards.
## Power Cores
The Power Cores used in the Space Ports and [[Hyperlanes]] was developed by [[Apoll-etric]] and uses a much more downsized version of the [[Ruscoaria]] [[Fusion Reactor]].
