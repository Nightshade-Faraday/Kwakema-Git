# Summary
Project Broken Barrel was the code name of a project by the [[Ruscoaria|Ruscorian]] government to build weapons that could wipe out anyone who questioned them. This would be the beginning of [[Cruxolutions]]. Once the contract was completed, the founder of [[Cruxolutions]] went on a buying spree of all the available transportation companies creating a monopoly over all transportation.
## Aftermath
Once all monopoly was cemented in place, Marcus Faraday stepped down and let their heir, [[Belladonna Faraday]], take over. Menina Faraday then lobbied to have laws put in place that would prevent any other company from doing what the founder did. In an effort to get these laws passed and get all countries on board, [[Cruxolutions]] made similar weapons to the ones they made for [[Ruscoaria]], this offer was refused by [[Mycologia]] and the [[Fellands#Fucrus|Fucrus]] . After this they withdrew from the weapons business and built a [[Telpenten#Fusion Reactor|Fusion Reactor]] for [[Ruscoaria]] as a show of peace before focusing completely on transportation.
