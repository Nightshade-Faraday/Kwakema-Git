The [[Ituk]] Mining Accidents are a series of unexplained "accidents" that led to the formation of [[Cumton Mining]]. Many of these accidents are covered up and suppresed by the [[Ituk]] government however a few were major enough to garner help from countries like [[Ruscoaria]] and [[Eplon]].
# "Accidents"
## Two Rivers Collapse
The Two Rivers Collapse happened early in the morning when locals heard a loud roar and felt the ground shake. This was immediately followed up with cries and screams for help. The locals would dig for 14 days before [[Telpenten]] would offer its services and help recover the bodies.
The government found no discernable cause for the collapse and ruled it as an act of God.
## Nine Dives Flood
The Nine Dives Flood was a lot more high profile as it happened in the middle of the day during a routine inspection of the fire suppression system. During a pressure test one of the newly fitted pipes burst and began flooding the lower areas of the mine. Due to an unexplained failure of the emergency shut off, 94 lives were lost.
# [[Cumton Mining]]
[[Cumton Mining]] was brought about when the government deemed the accidents to be too costly and forced all the mining companies in the area to merge under the newly established [[Cumton Mining]].
