After an accident at a lab in an undisclosed location a viral disease that spread via spores. This would begin to infect the wildlife and the surrounding land decimating the land.

## Experiments
The goal of the [[Nightsroft]] and [[Cybernira]] experiments was to synthesize a compound that would combine both human and animalistic features. These hybrids would then be marketed to different militaries and private companies.
The mixing and dual experimentation was facilitated through the use of pneumatic tubes and [[Cruxolutions]] rail lines. The tubes were used to transfer test samples and experiment documents. The rail lines were used to transport equipment and test subjects between facilities and in and out of [[Fellands#Fucrus|Fucrus]]. 
# Containment
After an accident that has been theorized to happen in one of the pneumatic tubes an experimental mixture of both [[Nightsroft]] and [[Cybernira]] became air born and began infecting everything in all attached facilities. This would then spread to the staff and then the surrounding land beginning the first round of the outbreak.
After the first round of containment attempts failed all uninfected staff were evacuated from the area and [[Telpenten]] was brought in to begin building walls while the [[Ruscoaria]] military was tasked with further containment at all cost. 
### Civilians
Once all staff were fully evacuated all uninfected civilians were evacuated. However by the time civilian evacuations were started most of them were in the early stages of infection and were denied evacuation.
## Military Intervention
Once the infection got majorly out of hand, the [[Ruscoaria]] military was brought in to try and exterminate the infected. With the clearance to contain the outbreak at all cost, a scorched earth policy was implemented. Ground troops were given flame thrower packs and told to burn anything that wasn't already charred. In addition to the burn crews, herbicides were air dropped over the area to kill anything that may have the chance to carry [[Nightsroft]].
### Walls
Once the infection had completely escaped the control of [[Verdanta]], the heads of the project and the company called in [[Telpenten]] to contract 300 meter tall walls that were 15 meters thick. 
### Warnings
Sometime later [[Verdanta]] brought [[Telpenten]] back to build in warning systems after the [[Outbreak Events#Cybernira Retrieval|cybernira retrieval]] events. The goal was to prevent people was getting close to ground zero and possibly drive them away.
