# Containment
## [[Verdanta]] 
Upon learning of the outbreak [[Verdanta]] began quarantine efforts and isolated Lab L-IEPAUG. However due to the pneumatic tube system used to transport samples, data and other materials between labs the quarantine efforts failed. Once this was noticed [[Verdanta]] began evacuation efforts for all staff in the affected areas.
## [[Ruscoaria]] Military
Upon being contacted by [[Verdanta]] and learning of the extensivity of the outbreak the Military of [[Ruscoaria]] sent in a team to manage civilian evacuation. At the same time several other teams were sent to begin destroying anything that was contaminated with either [[Nightsroft]] or [[Cybernira]].
# Walls
While the [[Ruscoaria|Ruscorian]] military was dealing with the evacuation and clean up efforts, [[Verdanta]] brought in construction and utility company [[Telpenten]] to begin building a wall around the affected zones.
# Cybernira
[[Cybernira]] was a top secret project from [[Verdanta]] made to make the [[Augments#Cybernetic|cybernetic augmentation]] process easier. Early test showed lots of promise as it was able to help bridge the gap between organic and mechanical. However due to the outbreak leaving it without any limiters or control it spread rapidly.
Due to [[Cybernira]]'s ability to infect most living things it wasn't long before it began infecting [[Nightsroft]]. This caused a rapid evolution of [[Nightsroft]] so that it could in turn infect [[Cybernira]]. 
## Cybernira Retrieval
After watching [[Cybernira]] and [[Nightsroft]] for months, [[Verdanta]] began making moves to revive the [[Cybernira]] program and begin work with it again. Thus a specialized task force was sent into retrieve a sample of [[Cybernira]] from the original lab and bring it back.
### Attempt 1
The first mission led to the lost of 3 members of the 7 person group. Failing to get a sample the team discovered that underneath the lab is a massive system of tunnels all filled with [[Cybernira]] and [[Nightsroft]] coexisting and growing.
### Attempt 2
The second mission led the remaining 4 into the caves where a sample was retived. It was also discovered that the [[Nightsroft]] in that area had evolved to eat through the material that makes up [[Exo-Suits]].
