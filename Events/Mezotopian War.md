The Mezotpian War was a major border dispute. Involving [[Eplon]] fighting a semi established [[Ituk]] while also trying to push into [[Fellands#Fucrus|Fucrus]]. Fucrus held their ground and the border moved into former [[Eplon]] territory a small bit. [[Ituk]] however was gaining lots of ground. Through the use of military and some citizens who picked up weapons to fight, [[Ituk]] outnumbered [[Eplon]] in terms of number of soldiers on the battlefield. This also meant that [[Ituk]] suffered many more losses.
At the end of the war [[Ituk]] had claimed the lower eastern and some of the upper eastern section of the continent.
