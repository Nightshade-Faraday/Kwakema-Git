Through the rise of several factions, connections have been brokered with the outside world. Some of these factions have used their connections to create unrest outside of the [[Fellands]] walls. This has led to riots in most countries most prominently [[Ruscoaria]]. 
Inside the walls its that the factions are dealing with their own riots, however it is between the different factions over how they are going about running the factions and their relationships.
Due to the high amount of riots, each country sent a representative to what has been now labeled "The Deadland Conference" due to its location being in the quarantined zones near the border of [[Ruscoaria]]. At the conference many solutions were proposed, from bombing the area to acquiescing to their demands. In the end it was decided that it would be best to begin sending in people to take down the factions and do recon just incase it may be possible to "clean up" the [[Fellands]] and return it to a livable state.
