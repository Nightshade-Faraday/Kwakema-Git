The [[Mycologia]] revitalization was an effort started by the newest king. She wanted to use [[Mycologia]]'s knowledge of plants and wildlife to help bring life back to the [[Fellands]].

## Mycologia
In [[Mycologia]] the plan to revitalize the [[Fellands]] was unpopular amongst the elders and those who still held onto the older ideas. For some of the younger ones they fully supported the plan while others just wanted to see where things were going and how they would turn out.

In an attempt to turn some of the elders to her side, the king decided that once the [[Fellands]] was revitalized [[Mycologia]] would then take them as either a vassal state or absorb them into [[Mycologia]].
