Let is be known... we did not fall. We were abandoned by everybody; everyone we trusted.
[[Verdanta]]. The people who brought us here under the guise of glory, helping people, furthering medical science. Fucking dipped the first moment something went wrong. The moment their little plans didn't work out; the moment that things didn't go the right way, they ran.
Then the military came. Not the [[Fellands#Lithos|Lithos]] military, not the [[Fellands#Fucrus|Fucrus]] military. No, no, no. Those countries don't really have a military. Their quote unquote "military" was fighting right next to us. 
No.. it was the [[Ruscoaria]] military. They came in, they started fighting with us and then things went left. It got stronger, we started running out of supplies, but we got craftier. At least... those that wanted to survive did.
--labored breathing accompanied by the sounds of running machinery--
And then the military left, panicked. Then [[Verdanta]] came back... not to help us. No, no, no. They came back to wall everything off. Brought in this other company... [[Telpenten]]. 
Of course they had no obligation to help us... they equipped their staff with these new [[Exo-Suits]], gave them enough rounds and stuff to escape and the built the wall. They put that wall up fast. 
At first they just tried to close it off, but then it broke down that wall and so they kept going and going and it slowly breached every wall.
And I'm sure that it'll breach the outer walls. They're thick as hell, its gonna take em a loooong time to do it... but it will. The inner walls... they didn't stop it. What makes you think the outer ones will?
We're in the deep zone, the revolution is fractured... scattered.

Hey Alejandro,

I know you're busy with the project and don't have time to talk. However, are you having second thoughts. I understand that what we are doing is meant to help people, but the people we are testing on aren't here willingly. I don't think what we are doing is ethical, these people are suffering and we should do something. I know you know how to do things through the right channels. Will you help me, please.
